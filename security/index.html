	<h1>Security Assessment of Game Center</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Ming Chow Industries hired me to evaluate the security of the web application Game Center. Game Center was developed to take in data from the new, very popular game 2048, developed by Gabriele Cirulli, and use it to create a High Score leader board. Unfortunately, there are vulnerabilities in Game Center that make it unacceptable as a web application.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>To find vulnerabilities in Game Center, I first conducted what is referred to as “black box” testing. “Black box” testing involves using tools such as proxies to try to modify code or gain access to the application’s information. I used the proxy Burp Suite for this phase. After “black box” testing, I went into the actual code to look for vulnerabilities myself.</p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>

	<h3>Adding Non-existent Database Fields</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Filling Up the Database</h3>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
