Comp 20: Web Programming


What is this repository for?

This repository was created as a place to store my work for this Web Programming class so that it would be easily 
gradeable by my professor and TAs.


What was your favorite project or lab?

My favorite project was the first one where we had to create a Resume webpage for ourselves. I thouroughly enjoyed
playing around with the HTML and CSS and I plan to continue to refine the page as a resource to show future employers.


What project or lab are you most proud of?

I am most proud of the third project in which we had to construct the MBTA map. I am most proud of this because I spent 
more time on it than any other project and had to completely start over in the middle of the project. If I was 
willing to put that much work into a project, I would have to be pretty proud of it.


How much do you think you have grown in terms of your potentials and/or abilities from this class: 
from day one in January to now? 

I think that I have grown a lot. I learned how to use developer tools, construct a web page, use APIs,
and how to set up a server and database. I have done this all in one semester and I definitely plan on
using this knowledge and building upon it in the future.
