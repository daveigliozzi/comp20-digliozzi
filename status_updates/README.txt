Lab 7: status update revisited

I honestly cannot get the heroku commands to work. I tried the commands ssh-keygen -t rsa and heroku keys:add that was
reccomended in the stackoverflow page but it's not working. I still get the same error message:
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

I have the app linked to my repo herokuapp_test, but I cannot figure out what is wrong.
